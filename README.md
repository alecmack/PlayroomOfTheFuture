# PlayroomOfTheFuture

The Playroom of the Future is an innovative project that aims to provide support to neurodiverse children to accelerate 
their cognitive and physical development through an interactive game. Our program focuses on teaching children life skills
that will empower them to reach their full potential in a crucial period of their development when they are forming crucial 
connections and neural pathways by increasing their physical activity, and helping them identify characters, animals, and words. 
The Playroom of the Future provides an interactive and immersive environment designed to help bridge the gap between neurodiverse 
children and their peers.

1	Opening the Application
To begin, download Playroom of the Future on all devices one wishes to use. Our application is scalable in terms of the numbers of devices;
there are several modes for varying numbers of devices, therefore it is up to the user to determine how many devices they would like to use 
as stations. Next, open the application on every device, making sure that every device is connected under the same network.

2	Start Screen
Users will be greeted with our start screen and two options: host, or client. From there, they must do the following:
Choose a device to be the “host”. This is the main device that will host the game, and once selecting the “host” option an IP address will be visible.
The remaining devices will be “clients”. Users will then have to input the IP address retrieved from Step 1 into the remaining devices, and select the client option.
The game will begin on all devices.

3	Gameplay Begins
Upon completion of the above steps, the game is set up on the devices. Now, all the user must do is determine where they want to locate
the stations (devices) and place them down for the child to play. 
Each station will have a different character for the child to interact with. Characters will have instructions for the child, and the 
child must complete that task at the specified station in order to progress the game. For example, a monkey may have text on the screen
telling the child to go to a turtle and tap the screen to help the turtle run. The child must then locate the station the turtle is, and
tap the screen. If the child attempts to interact with the wrong station, more text will appear and reiterate the task necessary to proceed.

4	Gameplay Ends
Once the child finishes the game, every device will have the same end screen (this feature is not yet implemented). The screen will display a
button that will send the user back to the start screen, where they may play the same storyline again or select another one.
